        content: "We are pleased to announce that our team (PI: Dr. Karatas) was awarded $29,950 grant by DOE for the project titled \"Analyzing the Impact of Windows Air Leakage on Energy Consumption of Low-Income Residential Houses\". This project aims to investigate the impact of air leakage on on the energy efficiency of buildings. Air leakage through window cracks and joints are majorly responsible for the buildingâ€™s heating and cooling energy loss. According to the ORNL 2020 study report, low-income households carry a burden of spending 13.9% of total income on energy bills versus 3.0% for other households, which is an overwhelming share of expense for a developing community. Energy efficiency measures in residential housing can be captured with deep energy retrofits, which increase affordability for residents while in the long-term helping preserve affordable housing by lowering operating expenses. However, it is still unknown how much air infiltration and leakage occurs through window.",

        content: "We are pleased to announce that our team (PI: Dr. Karatas) was awarded $212,000 grant by STO Corporation for the project titled \"Comparing Actual and Theoretical Energy Efficiency Performances of Prefab Building Assemblies\". This project aims to measure and evaluate the actual energy efficiency of prefab building assemblies. This project is expected to bridge the gap between actual energy consumption vs. predicted energy consumption of buildings and will help decision-makers improve their building design and energy performance analysis, and reduce their operational costs. Preparations for this project are already underway!",
