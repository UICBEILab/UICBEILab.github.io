        content: "We are pleased to announce that our team (PI: Dr. Karatas) was awarded $29,950 grant by DOE for the project titled \"Analyzing the Impact of Windows Air Leakage on Energy Consumption of Low-Income Residential Houses\". This project aims to investigate the impact of air leakage on on the energy efficiency of buildings. Air leakage through window cracks and joints are majorly responsible for the buildingâ€™s heating and cooling energy loss. According to the ORNL 2020 study report, low-income households carry a burden of spending 13.9% of total income on energy bills versus 3.0% for other households, which is an overwhelming share of expense for a developing community. Energy efficiency measures in residential housing can be captured with deep energy retrofits, which increase affordability for residents while in the long-term helping preserve affordable housing by lowering operating expenses. However, it is still unknown how much air infiltration and leakage occurs through window.",

        content: "We are pleased to announce that our team (PI: Dr. Karatas) was awarded $212,000 grant by STO Corporation for the project titled \"Comparing Actual and Theoretical Energy Efficiency Performances of Prefab Building Assemblies\". This project aims to measure and evaluate the actual energy efficiency of prefab building assemblies. This project is expected to bridge the gap between actual energy consumption vs. predicted energy consumption of buildings and will help decision-makers improve their building design and energy performance analysis, and reduce their operational costs. Project Start March 2022- Finish December 2023 (Expected)",

        title: 'Grant Awarded by STO Corporation',
        content: "We are excited to introduce our groundbreaking project sponsored by STO Corp. BEI Lab received $199,950 to conduct research studies on comparing the thermal performance and water/air resistance of wall panel joints in both prefab and precast building assemblies. As the industry currently leans towards precast panels, largely due to an experiential knowledge void about prefab performance, our research aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of both, paving the way for informed choices in modern construction. This endeavor not only fills a critical research void but also equips construction professionals with insights essential for future projects.",

        title: "Grant Awarded by STO Panel ",
        content: "We are very happy to announce that our team (PI: Dr. Karatas) received a new grant from STO Panel Technology to enhance incorporating thermal imaging technology for monitoring the thermal performance, air, and water leakage of STO (Exterior Insulation and Finish System) wall panels. The addition of thermal imaging will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the STO wall panels in terms of energy efficiency, insulation performance, and the detection of potential issues related to air and water infiltration.",
