        "The purpose of this study is to incorporate thermal imaging technology to monitor thermal performance, air, and water leakage of STO (Exterior Insulation and Finish System) wall panels. The thermal imaging analysis will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the STO wall panels in terms of energy efficiency, insulation performance, and the detection of potential issues related to air and water infiltration."

        "Air leakage through window cracks and joints are majorly responsible for the building’s heating and cooling energy loss. According to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory 2020 study report, low-income households carry a burden of spending 13.9% of total income on energy bills versus 3.0% for other households, which is an overwhelming share of expense for a developing community. Energy efficiency measures in residential housing can be captured with deep energy retrofits, which increase affordability for residents while in the long-term helping preserve affordable housing by lowering operating expenses. However, it is still unknown how much air infiltration and leakage through window cracks and joints affect the energy consumption of households. As cities look to improve their affordable housing options, the demand for cost-effective energy efficient retrofit solutions is growing to address more equitable uptake in envelope improvements"

Specifically, we seek to compare the theoretical and experimental thermal performance and water/air resistance of wall panel joints in prefab and precast building assemblies. This research builds upon a previous project sponsored by STO that aimed to provide a scientifically tested evaluation of the thermal performance of overall panel assemblies and their boundary conditions."

        "Aging infrastructure presents significant challenges across various industries, including the mechanical insulation workforce. Mechanical insulators play a crucial role in maintaining and improving the energy efficiency and safety of industrial facilities. However, as infrastructure ages, it becomes more vulnerable to deterioration and inefficiency, requiring specialized insulation solutions. This project will investigate the current challenges faced by the mechanical insulation workforce in the context of aging infrastructure. Our proposed approach involves conducting focus groups and surveys to gather valuable insights from industry professionals."

Our goal is a healthier community, informed about early detection and proactive mold prevention. As we work to safeguard residents against climate change effects, we use techniques co-developed with the SW Chicago community. While existing technologies like infrared imaging and odor meters offer mold detection, they're labor-intensive, lack precision, and require expert analysis. Many current detection methods, such as bulk sampling, are invasive, potentially damaging properties."
